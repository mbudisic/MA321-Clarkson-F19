**Welcome to MA571!**

Introductory courses on differential equations typically introduce analytical techniques for obtaining solutions to differential equations. However, most differential equations (especially nonlinear) do not fit any of the solution recipes. 

In this course, we will concern ourselves with discretization of differential equations (ODEs and PDEs) --- approximation of differential equations that allow us to "shed" their burden of infinitesimal objects (derivatives, in particular).

We will attempt to strike a balance between computational aspects (writing computer programs) and analysis aspects (proving, analyzing, comparing). The main audience for this class are graduate students in mathematics. However, engineers and scientists may also benefit from this content.
