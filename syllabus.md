## Summary of the class


## Topics and textbook

[![./img/lebl-cover-photo.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/img/lebl-cover-photo.jpg){:width="15%" style="float: right;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"}](https://www.jirka.org/ra/)

Detailed list of topics can be found in the [Schedule](./schedule.html) section of this site. These topics correspond to topics from n [**Jiri Lebl's, Basic Analysis: Introduction to Real Analysis Vol I.**](https://www.jirka.org/ra/) The book is completely free to use in PDF form. I strongly encourage you **buy the hardcopy**: either the [lulu.com version (purple)](http://www.lulu.com/shop/jiri-lebl/basic-analysis-i-introduction-to-real-analysis-volume-i/paperback/product-24102440.html) or [Amazon version](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1718862407). They are about $15 to defray costs of printing.

**Regular and frequent access to textbook is mandatory.** Any format of the textbook is fine (ebook, hardcopy, borrowed, owned), but don't count that "sharing a textbook" and occassionally looking at it will be enough. I specifically chose the book that is inexpensive so that everyone can afford the hardcopy. If you cannot, please come see me and I'll find a way to get you a printed copy.

**Why the hard-copy push?** I insist on hard-copy textbooks because writing proofs requires intense concentration, free from distractions. If you need to have a laptop or a tablet open to work on proofs, you expose yourself to distractions that sap your concentration. Be better than that..

## Prerequisites

Introductory proof-based class, like Clarkson's MA211. If this is the first time you will be writing proofs, then you should first sign up for MA211.

If you are looking for completing a math-minor, this class is likely not the best idea (except for those CS students who are pursuing theoretical CS). Dr. Fulton maintains a [list of Fall 2019 courses that are **much better** suited for math minor](https://web2.clarkson.edu/class/ma211/).

## Course work

#### Preparation for classes

Students are expected to read the textbook **ahead** of the lecture. The lectures will assume that students have read at least once through the listed chapters. The preparation will be tested through [Journals](./journal.html).

#### Participation and Note-taking

#### Homeworks

There will be 10 homeworks during the semester. Students are expected to work together to solve the problems, but then each of the student has to put together their own individual report that they will submit.

It is expected that solutions to the homework will strive for mathematical maturity - the goal is not just to get the solution, but to justify and interpret the steps along the way.

The main purpose of the homework is to expose you to the problems and the level of rigor expected of you in this class, and give you feedback. However, the accuracy of the homeworks will not contribute to your grade.

## Assessment

There will be two midterms and a final.

The grade will be based on your score on midterms and on the final exam. You will get feedback on homeworks, but that feedback will not factor into your final grade. You will have to submit all homeworks, however, to get a passing grade in this course.

I may offer portions of midterm for re-do, in order to boost your grade. Only students who have submitted all homeworks, and 90% of journal entries will be eligible to do so.

## Accommodations

I will do my best to arrange for any necessary accommodations that would enable you to fully participate in this class. If you require assistance during the lectures or during exams, please register with the [AccessABILITY Services](https://www.clarkson.edu/accessability-services).

## Ethical Behavior

From the Student Manual: _The Clarkson student will
not present, as his or her own, the work of another,
or any work that has not been honestly performed,
will not take any examination by improper means,
and will not aid and abet another in any dishonesty.
Failure to adhere to this code will mean a failing
grade and a report to the Dean of Students._
