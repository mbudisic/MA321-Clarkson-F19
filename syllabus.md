## Topics and textbook

[![./img/meiss-textbook.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/img/meiss-textbook.jpg){:width="15%" style="float: right;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"}](https://my.siam.org/Store/Product/viewproduct/?ProductId=28569997)


These topics roughly correspond to chapters 1-5, with selection of topics from chapters 6-8 in the textbook by [**James Meiss, Differential Dynamical Systems (SIAM) Revised Ed.**](https://my.siam.org/Store/Product/viewproduct/?ProductId=28569997) 

**Regular and frequent access to textbook is mandatory.** Any format of the textbook is fine (ebook, hardcopy, borrowed, owned), but don't count that "sharing a textbook" and occassionally looking at it will be enough. The "Revised edition" is recommended. The book's price can be reduced from $87 to $61 by **joining SIAM for free!**. If you are using the previous edition of the book, check the Preface of the Revised edition to see what the differences are.

### Should I join SIAM? What's SIAM again?

SIAM -- Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics is the main professional society for most faculty and students at Clarkson's Department of Mathematics. [**Membership for our students is free**, so you should join right away (click here)](https://www.siam.org/Membership/Join-SIAM/Individual-Members/Student) (before the class begins).

## Prerequisites

Undergraduate-level differential equations class (ODEs), strong background in calculus, preferrably with exposure to proof-based calculus ("advanced calculus" or "real analysis"), undergraduate-level linear algebra.

Occassionally, homeworks will require coding in MATLAB.

## Course work

#### Participation and Note-taking

Students are expected to come to class regularly.

In each class, two students will have the responsibility for taking accurate notes. The primary notetaker will do most of the work, while the secondary notetaker will make sure that no gaps or mistakes are present in the notes. After class, the two notetakers will type up the notes in LaTeX, make sure the file compiles, and then send the `.tex` file to the instructor who will keep the "master copy" of class notes for all to share and have access to.

#### Homeworks

There will be 6-8 homeworks during the semester. Students are expected to work together to solve the problems, but then each of the student has to put together their own individual report that they will submit.

It is expected that solutions to the homework will strive for mathematical maturity - the goal is not just to get the solution, but to justify and interpret the steps along the way.

The main purpose of the homework is to expose you to the problems and the level of rigor expected of you in this class.

## Assessment

There will be a midterm and a final. A portion of each exam will be in-class and a portion will be take-home.

The grade will be based on your score on the midterm and on the final exam. You will get feedback on homeworks, but that feedback will not factor into your final grade. You will have to submit all homeworks, however, to get a passing grade in this course.

## Accommodations

I will do my best to arrange for any necessary accommodations that would enable you to fully participate in this class. If you require assistance during the lectures or during exams, please register with the [AccessABILITY Services](https://www.clarkson.edu/accessability-services).

**Parents:** I know that many of our graduate students juggle their graduate school with being a good and present parent for their children. If you need to bring your child to work with you during a snow day (or for any other reason), they're welcome to sit in class and play while we work (providing they're not too loud). If you need any other arrangements made, please consult me - I am open to suggestions and will honor them, as long as they don't derail objectives (and objectivity) of the class.

## Ethical Behavior

From the Student Manual: _The Clarkson student will
not present, as his or her own, the work of another,
or any work that has not been honestly performed,
will not take any examination by improper means,
and will not aid and abet another in any dishonesty.
Failure to adhere to this code will mean a failing
grade and a report to the Dean of Students._

**Since this is a graduate class, I will be exceptionally strict regarding (un)ethical behavior.** I understand that different universities, professions, countries have different standard for ethical behavior. If you are not sure how to collaborate with your classmates in an ethical fashion, or how to use online resources, please consult me - there is no shame in asking.

In particular, your homeworks, midterms, or finals may be unsupervised, or take-home exams. During those exams, it will be incumbent upon your honor to use only allowed tools/notes, and not discuss the material with anyone else until you (and they) turn the work in.
