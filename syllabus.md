# Topics

We will cover several techniques for numerical solutions of Ordinary Diffeerential Equation systems, both those with primarily educational value, and those that can be encountered in numerical packages such as [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/choose-an-ode-solver.html), Python [scipy.integrate.ode](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.ode.html), and Julia's [DifferentialEquations.jl](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/solvers/ode_solve.html#Recommended-Methods-1).

**Prerequisites:** Undergraduate level multivariate calculus, differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ability to code in either Matlab, Python, or Julia. An excellent catch-all reference book is [Kreyszig's Advanced Engineering Mathematics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1426461.Advanced_Engineering_Mathematics) (any edition).
