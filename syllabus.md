## Summary of the class

This class serves a dual purpose:

1. It provides students with the rigourous foundation of infinitesimal calculus, including properties of real numbers and their sequences and series, basic function theory and operations of differentiation and integration.
2. It sharpens the reading and writing of proofs in the context of mathematical analysis.

By the end of this class, successful students will:

- be able to explain the differences between the set of real numbers and the set of fractions/decimals, including answer questions such as "Is 0.9999... = 1?"
- be able to discuss various limits of sequences and ordered infinite sums (series) of real numbers,
- use concepts and theorems, such as Bolzano--Weierstrass and Cauchy sequences, that underlie topology,
- be able to rigorously analyze continuity properties of functions and their sequences, and formulate proofs based on this property,
- be able to provide rigorous definition of a single-variable derivative and differentiability of functions, with all its implications on properties of the function
- be able to provide rigorous definition of integrals, including proving the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
- distinguish between pointwise and uniform convergence of a sequence of functions,
- integrate all that was learned to prove theorems on existence and uniqueness of solutions of ODEs,
- sharpen their proof-writing skills to the advanced-undergraduate level.

For those students aiming to enter graduate programs in mathematics, this course is indispensible.

## Topics and textbook

[![./img/lebl-cover-photo.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/img/lebl-cover-photo.jpg){:width="15%" style="float: right;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"}](https://www.jirka.org/ra/)

Detailed list of topics can be found in the [Schedule](./schedule.html) section of this site. These topics correspond to topics from n [**Jiri Lebl's, Basic Analysis: Introduction to Real Analysis Vol I.**](https://www.jirka.org/ra/) The book is completely free to use in PDF form. I strongly encourage you **buy the hardcopy**: either the [lulu.com version (purple)](http://www.lulu.com/shop/jiri-lebl/basic-analysis-i-introduction-to-real-analysis-volume-i/paperback/product-24102440.html) or [Amazon version](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1718862407). They are about $15 to defray costs of printing.

**Regular and frequent access to textbook is mandatory.** Any format of the textbook is fine (ebook, hardcopy, borrowed, owned), but don't count that "sharing a textbook" and occassionally looking at it will be enough. I specifically chose the book that is inexpensive so that everyone can afford the hardcopy. If you cannot, please come see me and I'll find a way to get you a printed copy.

**Why the hard-copy push?** I insist on hard-copy textbooks because writing proofs requires intense concentration, free from distractions. If you need to have a laptop or a tablet open to work on proofs, you expose yourself to distractions that sap your concentration. Be better than that..

## Prerequisites

Introductory proof-based class, like Clarkson's MA211. If this is the first time you will be writing proofs, then you should first sign up for MA211.

If you are looking for completing a math-minor, this class is likely not the best idea (except for those CS students who are pursuing theoretical CS). Dr. Fulton maintains a [list of Fall 2019 courses that are **much better** suited for math minor](https://web2.clarkson.edu/class/ma211/).

## Course work

#### Preparation for classes

Students are expected to read the textbook **ahead** of the lecture. The lectures will assume that students have read at least once through the listed chapters. The preparation will be tested through [Journals](./journal.html).

I suggest that you **take some amount of time during the weekend** and complete the readings and journal questions. That way you won't risk running out of time during the week, and you'll need only a quick skim before the class to get up to speed.

#### Participation and Note-taking

During class, you should expect to work actively. I will assume you have completed the assigned readings for the class and I will strive not to go over every detail from the textbook. Rather, we'll work on problems, discuss questions, etc.

**Do not be surprised if you have to work in pairs, on the blackboard, etc. ** Despite its reputation, mathematics is a collaborative discipline. Most of your time thinking about this class will likely be spent alone. We'll use the class time to work together.

You will need a notebook (preferrably physical), and a (thin) **three-ring binder**. You will complete your journal entries on a three-holed paper, and after I check you off, you'll file the required pages into your binder.

#### Homeworks

There will be 10 homeworks during the semester. Students are expected to work together to solve the problems, but then each of the student has to put together their own individual report that they will submit. There will be several mandatory problems on each homework, and a few optional ones. Students aiming for high-Bs and As should definitely attempt to complete optional problems every time.

It is expected that solutions to the homework will strive for mathematical maturity - the goal is not just to get the solution (solutions are typically known in this class, or can be looked up), but to justify and interpret the steps along the way.

The main purpose of the homework is to expose you to the problems and the level of rigor expected of you in this class, and give you feedback. However, the accuracy of the homeworks will not contribute to your grade.

## Assessment

The grade will be based on your score on **two midterms and on the final exam**. The exams will have questions labeled according to the level of difficulty (C-level, B-level, A-level); completing higher-level problems will award you the appropriate grade.

You will get feedback on homeworks, but **feedback on homeworks will not factor into your final grade**. You will **have to submit all homeworks on time**, however, to get D or higher in this course. (Necessary, but not sufficient condition.)

I may offer portions of midterm for re-do, in order to boost your grade. Only students who have submitted all homeworks, and 90% of journal entries will be eligible to do so.

## Accommodations

I will do my best to arrange for any necessary accommodations that would enable you to fully participate in this class. If you require assistance during the lectures or during exams, please register with the [AccessABILITY Services](https://www.clarkson.edu/accessability-services).

## Ethical Behavior

From the Student Manual: _The Clarkson student will
not present, as his or her own, the work of another,
or any work that has not been honestly performed,
will not take any examination by improper means,
and will not aid and abet another in any dishonesty.
Failure to adhere to this code will mean a failing
grade and a report to the Dean of Students._
