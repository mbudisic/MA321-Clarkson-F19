## Topics

We will relatively-closely follow the textbook by Arieh Iserles, _A First Course in the Numerical Analysis of Differential Equations_ (Cambridge), **2nd Edition** (any format is fine).

The course will be split between topics in numerical solutions of ODEs, where we'll cover multistep and Runge--Kutta methods




Homeworks will be assigned and collected on <https://cocalc.com/app> -- no exceptions. You'll have the freedom of working in Python, Julia, or Matlab/Octave. The analytical components will be typeset in either LaTeX or Markdown.


We will cover several techniques for numerical solutions of Ordinary Diffeerential Equation systems, both those with primarily educational value, and those that can be encountered in numerical packages such as
**Prerequisites:** Undergraduate level multivariate calculus, differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ability to code in either Matlab, Python, or Julia. An excellent catch-all reference book is [Kreyszig's Advanced Engineering Mathematics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1426461.Advanced_Engineering_Mathematics) (any edition).
