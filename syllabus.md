## Topics and textbook

[![./img/meiss-textbook.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/img/meiss-textbook.jpg){:width="15%" style="float: right;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"}](https://my.siam.org/Store/Product/viewproduct/?ProductId=28569997)


These topics roughly correspond to chapters 1-4, 6, 8-10, 16-17 in the textbook by [**James Meiss, Differential Dynamical Systems (SIAM) Revised Ed.**](https://my.siam.org/Store/Product/viewproduct/?ProductId=28569997) 

**Regular and frequent access to textbook is mandatory.** Any format of the textbook is fine (ebook, hardcopy, borrowed, owned), but don't count that "sharing a textbook" and occassionally looking at it will be enough. The "Revised edition" is required. The book's price can be reduced from $87 to $61 by **joining SIAM for free!**.

SIAM -- Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics is the main professional society for most faculty and students at Clarkson's Department of Mathematics. [**Membership for our students is free**, so you should join right away (click here)](https://www.siam.org/Membership/Join-SIAM/Individual-Members/Student) (before the class begins).

## Prerequisites

Undergraduate level multivariate calculus, differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ability to code in either PyJuMa. An excellent catch-all reference book is [Kreyszig's Advanced Engineering Mathematics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1426461.Advanced_Engineering_Mathematics) (any fairly-recent edition).

You will not do well in this class if you've never used a programming language independently. If you think you need to brush up on your programming skills, take the time ahead of the class to practice.

## Course work

#### Participation and Note-taking

...

#### Homeworks

#### Exams

There will be a midterm and a final.

A portion of the exam will be in-class and a portion will be take-home.

## Assessment

The grade will be based on your score on the midterm and on the final exam. You will get feedback on homeworks, but that feedback will not factor into your final grade. You will have to submit all homeworks, however, to get a passing grade in this course.

## Accommodations

I will do my best to arrange for any necessary accommodations that would enable you to fully participate in this class. If you require assistance during the lectures or during exams, please register with the [AccessABILITY Services](https://www.clarkson.edu/accessability-services).

**Parents:** I know that many of our graduate students juggle their graduate school with being a good and present parent for their children. If you need to bring your child to work with you during a snow day (or for any other reason), they're welcome to sit in class and play while we work (providing they're not too loud). If you need any other arrangements made, please consult me - I am open to suggestions and will honor them, as long as they don't derail objectives (and objectivity) of the class.

## Ethical Behavior

From the Student Manual: _The Clarkson student will
not present, as his or her own, the work of another,
or any work that has not been honestly performed,
will not take any examination by improper means,
and will not aid and abet another in any dishonesty.
Failure to adhere to this code will mean a failing
grade and a report to the Dean of Students._

**Since this is a graduate class, I will be exceptionally strict regarding (un)ethical behavior.** I understand that different universities, professions, countries have different standard for ethical behavior. If you are not sure how to collaborate with your classmates in an ethical fashion, or how to use online resources, please consult me - there is no shame in asking.

In particular, your homeworks, midterms, or finals may be unsupervised, or take-home exams. During those exams, it will be incumbent upon your honor to use only allowed tools/notes, and not discuss the material with anyone else until you (and they) turn the work in.
