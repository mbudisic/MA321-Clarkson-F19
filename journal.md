1. TOC
{: toc style="font-size:10pt; column-count:3; column-width: 20px; column-gap: 20px;" }

For every topic below, I will choose several questions, prompts, definitions, etc. that you either have to find in the listed chapter or answer on your own. My goal here is not to ask anything too difficult, but rather focus your reading.

I will regularly check if you're maintaining your journal. At beginning of each class meeting, you will submit answers to the prompts on one (preferrably) sheet of three-hole punched paper. After I check that you completed your work, I'll return the sheet to you. Then you will put the sheet into your 3-hole binder to serve as a reference for the rest of the semester.

Journal entries should contain:
- summary of the reading
- answers to questions
- any musings/thoughts/questions about the material read

## Week 1
### Mon  -- Sep 2	-- Math Girls, Syllabus, Motivation articles

- Read [the syllabus](./syllabus.html)
- Read [the article on Navier--Stokes equations](https://theconversation.com/millennium-prize-the-navier-stokes-existence-and-uniqueness-problem-4244). Optionally, you can [read this one as well](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-find-wrinkle-in-famed-fluid-equations-20171221/).
- Explain: what does "existence of solutions" refer to?
- What are "harmonic numbers"and what is the "harmonic series"?
- What does "real analysis" mean?

### Wed  -- Sep 4	-- Lebl 0.3 - Basic set theory + TBB, Appendix A.

- What is the "set-building notation"? Give an example that uses it that's not given in the reading for the class.
- What proving technique (direct, contraposition, contradiction,...) is used to construct the proof for Theorem 0.36. Review proving techniques from your MA211 notes, TBB readings, or [supplementary material for this course](https://mbudisic.github.io/MA321-Clarkson-F19/syllabus.html#additional-resources), e.g., *How to Solve It*, *How to Prove It*.
- Sketch a Venn diagram that demonstrates two DeMorgan rules.
- Given the statement "Every prime number larger than 2 is odd", write its:
  - contrapositive statement
  - contradictory statement (negation)
- Explain the difference between "induction" and "strong inducation" principles.


### Fri  -- Sep 6	-- Lebl 0.3 Functions and cardinality + TBB, Appendix A

- The textbook statesthat a definite integral $$\int_0^1 g(x) dx$$ can be interpreted as a function, having (some other) functions as inputs, and scalars as outputs. What is the domain of this "definite integral" function, and what is its range?
- Books sometimes mention the term "codomain". Look up the definition (say in Wikipedia or in readings) and explain how this is different than "range".
- For function $$f(x) = x^2$$, where $$x\in\mathbb{R}$$, give:
  - domain
  - range
  - direct images of  $$I_1=(-\infty,0)$$, $$I_2=(-\infty,\infty)$$,
  - inverse image (or preimage) of $$S_1 = \{0\}$$, $$S_2 = \{1\}$$, $$S_3 = \{-1\}$$
- After reading through Example 0.3.25, explain why the following calculation is unambiguous: 
$$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3}= \frac{3}{6} + \frac{4}{6} = \frac{7}{6}$$.
- What is the difference between a "proper subset" and just "subset"?
- Give an example of a countably-infinite set, and an uncountably-infinite sets. Come up with examples that were not given in the book.


## Week 2
### Mon  -- Sep 9	-- 1.1 Basic properties of real numbers -- Order, supremum, infimum

- Example 1.2.3. (from next section) shows that $$\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{R}$$ and that it's a unique number. Do you know a simpler proof that $$\sqrt{2} \not \in \mathbb{Q}$$? If you do, write it out.
- Write out definitions:
  - Lower bound
  - Infimum
  - Completeness (or least-upper-bound property)
- Prove that if supremum (or infimum) exist, they are necessarily unique. [If you're a careful reader, you can find it in the text.]
- Notice how much of this section is about inequalities. (Just notice and ponder what this means for the rest of this class.)
- Example 1.1.10 states that $$\mathbb{C}$$ can be ordered, and that it's also a field. But it's not an *ordered field*. Explain the technical/definitional reason for this (that is: what makes a field that is also *ordered set* into an *ordered field*).

### Wed  -- Sep 11	-- 1.2. Set of real numbers - Density

- In the proof of Prop. 1.2.2 there is a "why?" moment. Answer "why".
- What is meant by "(ordered) set A is dense in set B"? Is (a) $$\mathbb{R}$$ dense in $$\mathbb{R}$$, (b) (a) $$\mathbb{N}$$ dense in $$\mathbb{N}$$, (a) $$\mathbb{Q}$$ dense in $$\mathbb{R}$$?
- Explain "Archimedean property" in words.

### Fri  -- Sep 13	-- 1.2. Set of real numbers - Suprema, infima, inequalities

- Explain the difference between *infimum* and *minimum* of a set. Give an example of a set for which only one (infimum or minimum) exist.
- Find the part of the book that says that if $$\forall x \in A, \forall y \in B$$ it holds $$x < y$$ implies only $$\sup A \leq \inf B$$ and **not** a strict inequality. Give an example of this that is *not* already in the book.
- Attempt to prove AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality.

## Week 3

### Mon  -- Sep 16	-- 1.2 Suprema and infima

No additional reading or questions. Read through exercises 1.2.9-1.2.17. and perhaps attempt to prove some (all?) of them. Record your impressions and observations.

### Wed  -- Sep 18	-- 1.3 Absolute value and boundedness

- Calculate $$\vert 10 \vert$$ and $$\vert -12 \vert$$ by using the definition of absolute value.
- Use the triangle inequality to provide an upper bound on $$\vert x^2 - 3x + 4 \vert$$ on $$-2 \leq x \leq 6$$ not using any calculators/computers.
- Solve Exercise 1.3.2.

### Fri -- Sep 20 -- Problem work

Today we'll work on some problems from past homeworks/journals/sections to jump-start studying for the Midterm.

Your journal task is to go over (some/most/all - up to you) past problems (homeworks and classwork) and record your first thoughts about what strategy should be pursued for each individual problem (regardless of whether you solved the problem originally or not).

Turn this sheet in at the end of the lecture so you can refer to it during the class.
