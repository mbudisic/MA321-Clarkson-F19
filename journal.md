1. TOC
{: toc style="font-size:10pt; column-count:3; column-width: 20px; column-gap: 20px;" }

For every topic below, I will choose several questions, prompts, definitions, etc. that you either have to find in the listed chapter or answer on your own. My goal here is not to ask anything too difficult, but rather focus your reading.

I will regularly check if you're maintaining your journal. At beginning of each class meeting, you will submit answers to the prompts on one (preferrably) sheet of three-hole punched paper. After I check that you completed your work, I'll return the sheet to you. Then you will put the sheet into your 3-hole binder to serve as a reference for the rest of the semester.

## Week 1
### Mon  -- Sep 2	-- Math Girls
### Wed  -- Sep 4	-- Lebl 0.3 - Basic set theory + TBB, Appendix A.

- What is the "set-building notation"? Give an example that uses it that's not given in the reading for the class.
- What proving technique (direct, contraposition, contradiction,...) is used to construct the proof for Theorem 0.36. Review proving techniques from your MA211 notes, TBB readings, or supplementary material for this course, e.g., *How to Solve It*, *How to Prove It*.
- Sketch a Venn diagram that demonstrates two DeMorgan rules.
- Given the statement "Every prime number larger than 2 is odd", write its:
  - contrapositive statement
  - contradictory statement (negation)
- Explain the difference between "induction" and "strong inducation" principles.


### Fri  -- Sep 6	-- Lebl 0.3 Functions and cardinality + TBB, Appendix A

- The textbook statesthat a definite integral $\int_0^1 g(x) dx$ can be interpreted as a function, having (some other) functions as inputs, and scalars as outputs. What is the domain of this "definite integral" function, and what is its range?
- Books sometimes mention the term "codomain". Look up the definition (say in Wikipedia or in readings) and explain how this is different than "range".
- For function $f(x) = x^2$, where $x\in\mathbb{R}$, give:
  - domain
  - range
  - direct images of  $I_1=(-\infty,0)$, $I_2=(-\infty,\infty)$,
  - inverse image (or preimage) of $S_1 = \{0\}$, $S_2 = \{1\}$, $S_3 = \{-1\}$
- After reading through Example 0.3.25, explain why the following calculation is unambiguous: 
$$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3}= \frac{3}{6} + \frac{4}{6} = \frac{7}{6}$.
- What is the difference between a "proper subset" and just "subset"?
- Give an example of a countably-infinite set, and an uncountably-infinite sets. Come up with examples that were not given in the book.
